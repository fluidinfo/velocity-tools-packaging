/**
 * This allows for a {@link Log} to optionally be attached to
 * a subclass in order to output logging messages. This is simpler
 * than constantly checking whether we have a Log or not in each
 * usage throughout the classes which could use logging.  Methods should
 * only be added to this as necessary.  Performance considerations
 * can also be made later if deemed necessary.  This is meant for internal
 * use and should NOT be relied upon by VelocityTools users.
