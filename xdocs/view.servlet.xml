        <p class="note">
        This page is still unfinished.
        Much of this needs to be moved or at least
        copied to a VelocityView page, as it
        applies to anything using a
        <a href="javadoc/org/apache/velocity/tools/view/VelocityView.html">VelocityView</a>
        instance under the covers (including the
        <a href="view.tag.html">VelocityViewTag</a>).
        <a href="index.html#Contribution">Help is welcome!</a>
        </p>
        <p>
        <a href="javadoc/org/apache/velocity/tools/view/VelocityViewServlet.html">Javadoc is here</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
        A typical application use-case for the VelocityViewServlet
        is to provide the view rendering layer for
        a servlet-based web application framework. The
        <a href="struts.html">VelocityStruts</a> subproject
        uses the approach to bring Velocity templates to the Struts 1
        application framework.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section name="Installation">
        <p>The VelocityViewServlet needs to be installed into your servlet container
        so it can handle all request for *.vm (velocity template) files. There are
        only two additional configuration files, and they are shown in
        detail below.</p>

        <subsection name="Servlet Setup">
            <p>
            The servlet configuration (<strong>web.xml</strong>) must be
            modified to include a reference to the VelocityViewServlet
            (or subclass thereof) which will perform the rendering. All *.vm files are
            mapped to this servlet which will populate the 'context' with
            Request, Session, and Application scopes plus any additional tools
            specified by your configuration (or provided as defaults). The servlet
            will use this contextual information and the Velocity Engine to
            render the template file.
            </p>
            <p>
            <strong>Note:</strong> Additional functionality can be achieved
            through subclassing the VelocityViewServlet, and will be discussed further in
            the <a href="view.layoutservlet.html">VelocityLayoutServlet page</a>.
            </p>
            <p><b>web.xml</b></p>
            <sourcecode>
&lt;!-- Define Velocity template handler --&gt;
&lt;servlet&gt;
  &lt;servlet-name&gt;velocity&lt;/servlet-name&gt;
  &lt;servlet-class&gt;
    org.apache.velocity.tools.view.VelocityViewServlet
  &lt;/servlet-class&gt;

  &lt;!-- 
    Unless you plan to put your tools.xml and velocity.properties
    under different folders or give them different names, then these
    two init-params are unnecessary.  The
    VelocityViewServlet will automatically look for these files in
    the following locations.
  --&gt;
  &lt;init-param&gt;
    &lt;param-name&gt;org.apache.velocity.toolbox&lt;/param-name&gt;

  &lt;/init-param&gt;

  &lt;init-param&gt;
    &lt;param-name&gt;org.apache.velocity.properties&lt;/param-name&gt;
    &lt;param-value&gt;/WEB-INF/velocity.properties&lt;/param-value&gt;

&lt;/servlet-mapping&gt;
            </sourcecode>
        </subsection>

        <subsection name="Velocity Configuration">
            <p>
            Velocity configuration is <strong>optional</strong>, and for
            most applications the defaults will work fine. The
            <strong>velocity.properties</strong> file contains settings that
            affect logging, encoding, and macro settings.</p>
            <p>The default configuration specifies the location of a 'global'
            Velocimacro template. This file can contain macros which will be
            made available to all templates.
            </p>
            <p>
            The location of the configuration file may be specified in web.xml,
            but it is recommended the file be placed inside the hidden WEB-INF
            directory of the web application and named 'velocity.properties' which
            is where the VelocityViewServlet will look for it in the absence of
            any location specified in the web.xml.
            An example configuration file is included with the distribution.
            </p>

        <subsection name="Toolbox Configuration">
            <p>
            The toolbox file (located at <strong>/WEB-INF/tools.xml</strong> by
            convention), maps out the "tools" and data we want available for
            our templates to use. It's easier than that sounds.
            </p>
            <p>
            Think about asking our friend Jon to grab us a 'wrench' from a
            real toolbox. Jon just needs to know which wrench we want (metric,
            pipe, crescent etc,). He doesn't need to know what the wrench does
            nor what we are planning to do with it.
            </p>
            <p>
            The Velocity Toolbox works the same way, we must only specify
            which tool we want, and then the Velocity engine takes
            care of the rest by making any public method available to the
            template. For example, from the definitions below, the template
            could call <code>$wrench.size</code>.
            </p>
            <p><b>PipeWrench.java</b></p>
            <sourcecode>
public class PipeWrench {
    public String getSize() {
        return "Large Pipe Wrench!";
    }
}
            </sourcecode>

            <p><b>tools.xml</b></p>
            <sourcecode>
&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt;
&lt;tools&gt;
&lt;toolbox scope="application"&gt;
 &lt;tool key="wrench" class="PipeWrench"/&gt;
&lt;/toolbox&gt;
&lt;/tools&gt;
            </sourcecode>

            <p class="subsubSection">Toolbox Scopes</p>

            <p>
            You may have noticed that toolbox support built into VelocityView
            also provides support for specifying the scope of your toolbox with
            regards to the servlet environment.
            Toolboxes may be placed within the <i>request</i>,
            <i>session</i>, or <i>application</i> scopes of your web app.</p>
            <p>The scope that you set for your toolbox will determine the
            lifecycle of the tools within it:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                <i>application</i> scoped tools will be instantiated only once when
                first used by a template and then reused by all templates for each
                subsequent request.  Due to this, it is <em>strongly</em> encouraged
                that your application scoped tools be completely threadsafe.  The 
                <a href="javadoc/org/apache/velocity/tools/generic/MathTool.html">MathTool</a>
                (one of the <a href="generic.html">GenericTools</a>) is a good example
                of tool meant to be application scoped.
                </li>

                <li>
                <i>session</i> scoped tools are instantiated at most once
                per unique session (if they are used by a template processed
                for that session) and are then reused for every request
                associated with that particular session.
                </li>

                <li>
                <i>request</i> is the most common scope.
                Tools with this scope are instantiated at most once per
                servlet request fed to that VelocityView (if they are used by
                a template processed during that request).
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p class="subsubSection">Tool Path Restrictions</p>

            <p>You can specify a restriction on the request URIs for which the tool
            will be available in the context using the "restrictTo" attribute of
            your tool configuration.
            It can be an exact request path (matching one page) or end with the
            <code>*</code> wildcard, meaning that incoming request paths need only
            start with the provided value for the tool to be available.
            For instance:</p>

            <sourcecode>
&lt;tool restrictTo="/catalog/*"
      class="com.mycompany.tools.CatalogTool"/&gt;
            </sourcecode>

            <p>
            You may have noticed that this example tool configuration doesn't
            have a "key" attribute.  This is because VelocityTools 2 honors the
            [Key]Tool naming convention.  So a tool with the simple name of
            "CatalogTool" will automatically be given the key "catalog" unless
            another key is specified in the tool configuration or using the
            <a href="javadoc/org/apache/velocity/tools/config/DefaultKey.html">DefaultKey</a>
            annotation on the class.
            </p>

            <p class="subsubSection">Tool Properties</p>
            <p>
            The toolbox support built into VelocityTools also provides
            support for passing configuration properties to tools.
            If a tool has a
            <code>public void configure(java.util.Map params)</code> method,
            then VelocityTools will pass that method a map of all properties
            set on the tool configuration, the toolbox to which it belongs and
            properties set for the whole configuration.
            </p>
            <p>
            VelocityTools will also use Commmons-BeanUtils to set any or all
            of those same properties directly on the tool if their keys and types
            have a matching public set[Key](Type) method on that tool.
            
            </p>
            <p>
            These things happen immediately
            after a tool instance is instantiated and before it is available to
            your templates.  This gives much flexibility in designing and configuring
            your tools.</p>
            <p>
            You can specify properties for your tools, toolboxes or all tools
            either as &lt;property&gt; tags or as attributes:
            </p>
            <sourcecode>
&lt;tools foo="true"&gt;
&lt;toolbox scope="application" someProperty="whatever"&gt;
    &lt;property key="bar"&gt;woogie&lt;/property&gt;
    &lt;tool key="myTool" class="com.foo.tools.MyTool"&gt;
        &lt;property name="my.parameter.name" value="my.parameter.value"/&gt;
    &lt;/tool&gt;
&lt;/toolbox&gt;
&lt;/tools&gt;
            </sourcecode>

            <p class="subsubSection">Static Data</p>
            <p>
            In addition to specifiying arbitrary Java classes as <b>tools</b>
            to be automatically available to your templates, the toolbox support
            also includes the ability to specify arbitrary strings, booleans,
            numbers, lists of those, and even BeanUtils-convertable types to be
            automatically available in your templates.  The format
            is as follows:
            </p>
            <sourcecode>
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot;?&gt;
&lt;tools&gt;
    &lt;data type="number" key="version" value="1.1"/&gt;
    &lt;data key="startdate" value="Mon Sep 17 10:08:03 PDT 2007" class="java.util.Date" 
             converter="org.apache.commons.beanutils.locale.converters.DateLocaleConverter"/&gt;
    &lt;data type="boolean" key="isSimple" value="true"/&gt;
    &lt;data key="foo" value="this is foo."/&gt;
    &lt;data key="bar"&gt;this is bar.&lt;/data&gt;
    &lt;data type="list" key="dataKeys"
             value="version,date,isSimple,foo,bar,dataKeys,switches"/&gt;
    &lt;data type="list.boolean" key="switches" value="true,false,false,true"/&gt;
&lt;/tools&gt;
            </sourcecode>

            <p>
            As with your tools, your data will be exposed to your templates
            under the specified key (e.g. $version, $startdate, $isSimple,
            $foo, $bar, $dataKeys and $switches). Unlike
            tools, data does not go in a toolbox and is not scoped (as it is
            necessarily static).
