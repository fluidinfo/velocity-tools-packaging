<p><a href="http://velocity.apache.org/tools/struts/">VelocityStruts</a>
is a subproject of the <a href="http://velocity.apache.org/">Apache Velocity</a>
project.
<br />
This is an example web application demonstrating the integration of the
<a href="http://struts.apache.org/">Struts 1.x web application framework</a>
with the Velocity template engine.
</p>

<h5>Highlights</h5>
<ul>
	<li>Velocity is now becoming an alternative view technology for Struts-based
	    Web applications.</li>
	<li>Velocity templates can be mixed with JSP templates in the same application.</li>
	<li>No changes are required to Struts. This works with Struts 1.3.x.</li>
</ul>

<h5>Status</h5>
<p>A great deal of progress has been made since our 1.0 release. These include
support for Struts 1.1 features like modules, Tiles, and Validator.  These features have been enhanced further
to support Struts 1.3.x.  For a more
complete listing, see the project <a href="http://velocity.apache.org/tools/changes.html">change log</a>.</p>

<h5>Application Examples</h5>
<p>Seven small <a href="$link.action.examples">application examples</a> have
been included. Look at example 2 for a demonstration of the Velocity
view tools for Struts. JSP versions of some of the examples have
been included to allow a direct comparison of the two view technologies.
